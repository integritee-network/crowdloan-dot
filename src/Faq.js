                    <p>Lenders will be rewarded with TEER tokens. This token has an intrinsic value, as it gives access to Integritee’s services,
                      as well as a market value, which will increase with adoption. Each supporter will be allocated TEER according to the following
                      formula: Your DOT contribution * 2.5 TEER = Your minimum reward. Additionally you can get more, if you meet the conditions of the
                      other rewards.
                      All Tokens will be vested linearly during the 24 months lease period starting from Aug 28<sup>th</sup> 2022</p></div>);
      case 3: return (<div className="text"><h3>How long will the tokens be locked?</h3>
                <p>Bonded DOT tokens will be locked for a total of 48 weeks, the duration of the lease if Integritee wins a slot.
                  If Integritee does not win one of the auctions during the crowdloan campaign, the DOT will be released
                  by the end of the crowdloan campaign, estimated to occur on Aug 28<sup>th</sup> 2022. </p></div>);
      case 4: return (<div className="text"><h3>How will my DOT be returned to me?</h3>
                    <p>All DOT tokens are automatically released to their owners at the end of the lease period. They never leave your custody. This process works directly between contributors and the Polkadot Network.</p></div>);
      case 5: return (<div className="text"><h3>What is unbonding?</h3>
                    <p>DOT tokens that are currently staked need to be unbonded (unstaked) before they can be bonded to a new crowd loan. There is a delayed exit period of 7 days during which tokens cannot be transferred to a new bond.
                    You can find out how to unstake on the <a href='https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000167902-how-can-i-unstake-my-tokens-again-'>Polkadot wiki</a>.
                    </p></div>);
      case 6: return (<div className="text"><h3>I have DOT on an exchange, do I need to unbond?</h3>
                    <p>The process depends on the exchange – contact them to find out how to participate, or see instructions on <a href='https://www.kraken.com/learn/parachain-auctions'>Kraken</a> and <a href='https://medium.com/kucoinexchange/kucoin-supports-the-kusama-parachain-slot-auction-5cc1793a2dfe'>KuCoin</a>. If your exchange does not support nomination directly, you will need to unbond your DOT tokens and transfer them to Polkadot.js. </p></div>);
      case 7: return (<div className="text"><h3>What happens if Integritee does not win the parachain auction?</h3>
                    <p>Integritee will continue to bid in subsequent auctions until it has won a lease, or until the end of our crowdloan campaign. If that happens all DOT tokens will be released to their owners.</p></div>);
      case 8: return (<div className="text"><h3>How can I get a referral code if I have already contributed?</h3>
                    <p>You will have to contribute another small amount (Min. amount = 5 DOT) to the crowdloan to receive a referral code.</p></div>);
      case 9: return (<div className="text"><h3>What happens to referral bonuses if Integritee does not win a slot during this campaign?</h3>
                    <p>The referral bonuses are linked to the TEER rewards for the crowdloan campaign. If Integritee does not win a slot by the end of our campaign,
                        all DOT will be unbonded and released to their owners and only the guaranteed rewards will be distributed, but not standard rewards or referral bonuses.</p></div>);

      case 10: return (<div className="text"><h3>I backed Integritee during earlier crowdloan campaigns and generated a referral link. Can I use my own referral link to contribute now?</h3>
                    <p>No. The bonus won’t be applied to your contribution. Please use someone else’s referral link to claim your bonus.</p></div>);

      case 11: return (<div className="text"><h3>What happens if someone uses my referral code from previous crowdloan campaigns to contribute now?</h3>
                    <p>They will get a 5% bonus on their TEER rewards. In order for you to also benefit from the reward, you will need to contribute again (at least 5 DOT) during the third batch of auctions.</p></div>);

      default: return (<div className="text"><h3>How does crowdlending work?</h3>
        <p>Polkadot parachain slots are leased, for a limited period, via slot auctions. Projects bid for
        auction slots with collateral in the form of DOT tokens. Crowdlending is one way for bidders to raise the collateral they need to win a slot. Integritee supporters can “lend” their
        tokens – in a process called bonding, staking, or nominating – to help the company achieve
        its goal of occupying slots on Polkadot.</p><p>Lenders (or “nominators”) never cede custody of their tokens; the bids are merely locked for the
        duration of the lease, and released in full at the end of the period. Integritee will never get access
        to your wallet or tokens and will never hold any contributions. This process works directly between contributors and the Polkadot Network.</p></div>);
